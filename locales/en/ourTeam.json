    "teamEquipmentTextFirstPar": "At KARG's disposal are four rescue vehicles and one fire truck, with the team itself comprising over twenty individuals - rescuers, drivers, dispatchers, programmers, mechanical engineers, garage supervisor, accountant, and legal consultant.",
    "teamEquipmentTextSecondPar": "The team members are either professional climbers, speleologists (cave explorers), or diggers (explorers of underground passages), thus they can reach animals from virtually any location.",
    "teamEquipmentTextThirdPar": "In addition, there is a motorboat and equipment for water operations available. In case of forest fires, the team utilizes a fire truck for extinguishing forest fires and a group of 10 volunteers who are not members of the rescue team.",
    "volontiersText": "Until now, the ranks of the Rescue Team have occasionally been replenished with new volunteers. To become a KARG rescuer, one must undergo training. However, many people join the team for a short period, and later they leave and do not return. There have been challenging periods in the organization when one person could perform several roles simultaneously and work for 4-5 shifts in a row. Despite this, throughout its existence, the Rescue Team has never suspended its operations. And volunteers who manage to stay in the organization for more than a month tend to stay here for a long time.",
    "donatesText": "The number of calls for help increases every day, but the number of paid missions does not grow: only a third of applicants are willing to pay for the service. There is no possibility of stable financial support. Therefore, rescuers are always grateful to donors, through whose help more animals will have a chance at life.",
